An array is a data structure cna store multiple elements.
Arrays are indexed, each element in the array has an index. (Index starting from zero)

my_array = [2, 5, 10, 8, 20, 90]
print(my_array[0]) # Output = 2

Write down the algorithm in something between human language and programming language,
the algorithm will be easier to implement later.

Task: Find the lowest value in the array

Steps:
Create a variable 'minVal' and set it equal to the first value of the array.
Go through every element in the array.
If the current element has a lower value than 'minVal', update 'minVal' to this value.
After looking at all the elements in the array, the 'minVal' variable now contains the lowest value.

In programming notation:
Variable 'minVal' = array[0]
For each element in the array
    If current element < minVal
        minVal = current element
