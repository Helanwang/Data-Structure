DSA:Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
Use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.

Data structures are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.

They help in managing and organizing data, reduce complexity, and increase efficiency.

Algorithms:
Steps to solve the problems

Data Structure:
How data can be stored in different structures.

Time Complexity: A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run,
depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.

Space Complexity: A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses,
depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.

Recursion	A programming technique where a function calls itself.

# there are inputs, the computers will process the data in a logical ways to reach the output
that we desired.

Great algorithms solve bigger problems. Imagine companies that have billions of datas, like google.

Big O running time. The worst running time it will take.
